Welcome to the seventh newsletter from **Security Without Borders**. This is a somewhat regular newsletter covering recent cyber security issues, tools and events relevant for activists, dissidents, journalists and civil society at large.

It has been some time since we sent a newsletter, but many things have been happening at SWB, even if most of them happened behind the scenes. We do intend to send these newsletters regularly again from now on.

> **Security Tip** Uninstall or disable Adobe's **Flash Player** from your computer (see this [HowTo](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-windows.html) from Adobe), or at least remove the corresponding plugin from your browser.
Though the security of Flash Player may have improved over the years, vulnerabilities in it continue to be regularly found and subsequently abuse to target users with malware. Moreover, fake Flash Player updates are often used as a lure in malware campaigns; if you don't run Flash Player, you can be certain such updates are fake. If you absolutely need to use Flash Player for a particular site or service, use a special device for it, or if that is not possible at least a decidated browser. At least for Firefox there is a [plugin to disable or reenable Flash on demand]<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashdisable/>, you may find it helpful.

## Security alerts

- An important [security update](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-browser-709-released) has been released for the **Tor Browser** for the macOS and Linux operating systems. The update fixes a vulnerability that an attacker, who is able to get you to visit a specially crafted URL, can find out your real IP address which could in turn lead to your identity being revealed. If you use the Tor Browser on either operating system, make sure you run at least version 7.0.9. Note that the Tails operating system is not affected by this vulnerability; users for whom the secrecy of their identity is extremely critical are advised to use [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/)].

- The **WordPress** content management system also released an important [security update](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-8-3-security-release/). If your website runs WordPress you are advised to update immediately. This may also be a good moment to check whether your installation supports automatic updates.
This is not the first time this newsletter warns of vulnerabilities in WordPress. Though the WordPress team works hard to quickly fix all security issues reported to them, for very critical sites a simple WordPress installation may not be good enough.

- Last month, a vulnerability was found in the protocol used for **encrypted WiFi connections**. The vulnerability, named [KRACK](https://www.krackattacks.com/), could allow someone who finds themselves close to the network to read the communication between a device and the WiFi router. The exploitability depends on the operating system and many vulnerable instances have been patched.
Though this is fairly serious as vulnerabilities go, it cannot be exploited remotely. Moreover, relying on the encryption of your WiFi connection is a bad idea anyway, as this doesn't protect you from a hack into your router, or a rogue employee at an ISP. Therefore, regardless of whether your connection is vulnerable to KRACK, you should make sure that any connection the content of which is even mildly important is already encrypted, for example using HTTPS.

## Informative reading

- The 2nd of November was the United Nations' [International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists](https://en.unesco.org/endimpunity-2017). Journalists increasingly face digital threats and Citizen Lab, who have written various reports on such threats, [listed](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/11/international-end-impunity-crimes-journalists/) three separated cases of attacks against journalists and news organisations.

## Tools

- Many high-risk users use various Google services, for example Gmail. Such users can now sign up for the company's free [Advanced Protection Program](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/), to seriously decrease the risks of a rogue account takeover, for example through phishing. One of the ways in which accounts are hardened is the use of a physical security key, which needs to be present before one can login. It is important to note that with added security comes added inconvenience, and certain ways of using Google (such as the use of external apps) will not be possible any more. For high-risk users, however, this is a compromise worth making.
