Welcome to the eighth newsletter from **Security Without Borders**. This is a somewhat regular newsletter covering recent cyber security issues, tools and events relevant for activists, dissidents, journalists and civil society at large.

> **Security Tip** Social media plays an important role in many activist communities and is widely used by journalists, and the potential risks of a hijacked account include more than mere embarrassment. As usual, it's advised to use strong, unique passwords combined with [two-factor authentication](https://theoutline.com/post/2489/two-passwords-are-always-better-than-one). In addition, an often forgotten threat is posed by third-party apps granted access to the accounts. A [website](https://www.permissions.review/) has been set up to help you find out which third-party apps have access to your various accounts. Remove access by any app you don't regularly use, or that doesn't provide actual benefits to your usage of the accounts.
