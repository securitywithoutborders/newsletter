Welcome to the eighth newsletter from **Security Without Borders**. This is a somewhat regular newsletter covering recent cyber security issues, tools and events relevant for activists, dissidents, journalists and civil society at large.

> **Security Tip** Social media plays an important role in many activist communities and is widely used by journalists, and the potential risks of an account hijack are more than mere embarrassment. As usual, it's advised to use strong, unique passwords combined with [two-factor authentication](https://theoutline.com/post/2489/two-passwords-are-always-better-than-one). In addition, an often forgotten threat is posed by third-party apps granted access to the accounts. A [website](https://www.permissions.review/) has been set up that helps you find out which third-party apps have access to your various accounts. Remove access by any app you don't regularly use, or that doesn't provide actual benefits to your usage of the accounts.
