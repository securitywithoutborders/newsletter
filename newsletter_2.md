## Security Alerts

In the month of January we have seen a good number of security vulnerabilities in prominent software. Here is a little recap, in case you are still behind on your software updates.

- **Cisco WebEx**: A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx browser extensions was disclosed on the 24th of January. This flaw would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected browser on an affected system. This vulnerability affects the browser extensions for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server and Cisco WebEx Centers (Meeting Center, Event Center, Training Center, and Support Center) when they are running on Microsoft Windows. Cisco has released software updates for Google Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer that address this vulnerability.

- **Netgear Routers**: The disclosed vulnerability essentially allows attackers to exploit the router’s password recovery system to bypass authentication and hijack admin credentials, giving them full access to the device and its settings. In case you own one of the listed routers, you’re strongly advised to update the firmware of your device in order to avoid risking getting hacked. Netgear has already posted a list of affected devices and the updated firmware on its [website](http://kb.netgear.com/30632/Web-GUI-Password-Recovery-and-Exposure-Security-Vulnerability).

- **Printers Multiple Vulnerabilities**: A research team from Ruhr-Universität Bochum in Germany discovered a very serious security issue that has been identified in about 20 printers and multi function devices from several vendors, including HP, Dell, Lexmark and Brother printers. All of them are affected by at least one issue that relies on a bad PostScript implementation. Exploitation can allow for a lot of dangerous activities – from playing pranks to carrying out complex sabotage. Abusing this mechanism an attacker can also obtain copies of print jobs when being outside of the target network. As a partial mitigation, administrators should never leave their printers accessible from the internet and should disable raw port 9100/tcp printing if not required. More advanced mitigations completely sandbox all printing devices into a separate VLAN, only accessible by a hardened print server. For more details refer to the researches [paper](https://www.nds.rub.de/media/ei/arbeiten/2017/01/13/exploiting-printers.pdf)

- **Wordpress**: A vulnerability was recently released, it affects versions 4.7 and 4.7.1 of the Wordpress content management system (CMS), allowing an unauthenticated attacker to modify all pages on unpatched sites and redirect visitors to malicious exploits and a large number of attacks. The flaw has been rated critical, although the fix has automatically been deployed on millions of WordPress installations in the few hours after the patch was issued. WordPress admins who have not yet implemented the patch against the nasty vulnerability are strongly advised to update their CMS to Wordpress version 4.7.2.

- **Phishing Campaigns Targeting Egyptian NGOs**: A new [report](https://citizenlab.org/2017/02/nilephish-report/) from the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs uncovers Nile Phish, an ongoing and extensive phishing campaign against Egyptian civil society. In recent years, Egypt has witnessed what is widely described as an ‘unprecedented crackdown,’ on both civil society and dissent. Amidst this backdrop, in late November 2016 Citizen Lab began investigating phishing attempts on staff at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), an Egyptian organization working on research, advocacy and legal engagement to support basic freedoms and rights.
